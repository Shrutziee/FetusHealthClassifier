    <h1>Project Description</h1>
    <p>Create a multiclass model to classify CTG features into the three fetal health states.</p>
    <p>Reduction of child mortality is reflected in several of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals and is a key indicator of human progress. The UN expects that by 2030, countries end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age, with all countries aiming to reduce underâ€‘5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1,000 live births.</p>
    
  <h2>Data</h2>
    <p>This dataset contains 2126 records of features extracted from Cardiotocogram exams, which were then classified by three expert obstetricians into 3 classes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Normal</li>
        <li>Suspect</li>
        <li>Pathological</li>
    </ul>
    
  <h2>What is a Cardiotocogram?</h2>
    <p>A cardiotocogram (CTG) is a technical means of recording the fetal heartbeat and the uterine contractions during pregnancy. It is used to monitor fetal well-being and to detect any fetal distress.</p>
